*Remove duplicate records from the merged Cyclistic dataset
*Dataset name: 2024_divvy_trip_data.cyclistic_data
#Assumption: Duplicates are defined as rows that are identical in all columns except for ride_id (i.e., the ride_id is different, but the ride details are the same).
#Goal: Keep only the first occurrence of each duplicate based on the earliest started_at timestamp.

#Step 1: Use a CTE to assign row numbers to potential duplicates
